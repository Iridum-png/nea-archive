## 🧐 About

The project is written largely in rust and python - python is the way that the machine learning model will be trained and rust will handle all the heavy lifting in the backend. It will eventually be bundled into a WASM project for deployment on the web.

The idea for this project was sparked by the work of DeepMind on AlphaZero, a chess engine which changed computer chess forever by implementing a neural network and proving itself convincingly against the best engine out at the time, Stockfish.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Todo

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
cargo/rustup to enable running of the rust files
Python (3.10+) to allow for running of the python files
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## 🎈 Usage 

Add notes about how to use the system.

## 🚀 Deployment 

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

## ⛏️ Built Using
